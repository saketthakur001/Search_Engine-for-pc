Assonance: use of vowel sound ‚ÄòI‚Äô (in his vivid stripes)
Oxymoron: use of adjectives opposite in meaning (quiet rage)
[10:59 am, 01/06/2021] +91 90659 95774: Literary devices

Rhyme: rhyme scheme is abcb (grass-pass)
Enjambment: Line continues to next line without punctuation marks. (Sliding through‚Ä¶.deer pass)
Alliteration: use of sound ‚Äòp‚Äô at the start of two words (plump pass)

[10:59 am, 01/06/2021] +91 90659 95774: Literary devices

Rhyme Scheme: abcb rhyme scheme is followed (edge, village)
Enjambment: Line continues to next line without punctuation marks (He should be snarling around houses At the jungle‚Äôs edge,)

Alliteration: use of sound ‚Äòh‚Äô in the starting of two words (he hears)
Assonance: use of ‚ÄòI‚Äô sound (with, his, brilliant)
[10:59 am, 01/06/2021] +91 90659 95774: - The poet has repeated the words to give a nice impact to his poem. Like the use of quiet with velvet pads describes that the tiger has to walk in the limited area of his cage. He cannot run as he would have done had it been in the forest. Whereas ‚Äòquiet rage‚Äô shows the hidden anger inside him which has grown stronger because of his confinement in the cage. The next word he used is ‚Äòbrilliant‚Äô. The word brilliant in the first line means the twinkling bright stars and the brilliant words used for the tiger‚Äôs eyes shows the sadness of the tiger who would have led a free and fearless life if it were in the jungle.
